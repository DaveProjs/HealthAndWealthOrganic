Every single disease is linked to cellular loss or damage. For instance, Diabetes occurs because either the beta cells of the pancreas responsible for secreting insulin are not adequate to secret insulin( insulin deficiency) or insulin receptors ( which are also cells) are not adequate to sense the presence of insulin leading to insulin insensitivity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong><a name=\"use\">Who Can Use STC ?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>STC30 is not just for the sick.

Some bodies respond faster to the therapy than others and the longer the patient has suffered from the disease the longer the time required to heal completely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong><a name=\"where\">Where Is STC Manufactured ?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>STC30 stem Cell is manufactured in Switzerland by Mibelle Biochemistry lab.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong><a name=\"any\">Is There Any Side Effects ?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, this is a plant based ,natural product, it does not have any side effects.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What are Stem Cells?
